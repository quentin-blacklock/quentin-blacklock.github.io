# Quentin Blacklock

### Software Development, Data Analytics, Strategic Management of Technology, People & Knowledge
_____

I have a strong manufacturing background with 20 + years of experience that includes operations, technology and management, that has prepared me for the challenges as business seeks digitally transformation.

I seek new opportunities to solve business problems through software development, data analytics, and the strategic management of technology, people and knowledge.

Passionate about lifelong learning, I am currently exploring gamification in business, Power BI, and social knowledge management. 

Outside of geek stuff, Quentin enjoys golfing, distance cycling, and craft beer.
