I will be speaking at [That Conference 2016](https://www.thatconference.com) which happens August 8 - 10.

My presentation is [Andriod Apps Without Code](https://www.thatconference.com/Sessions/Session/10702). 

Learn to build android apps in a visual way utilizing drag-and-drop building blocks in an easy to use, cloud based development tool.

This project is a fun parent - child activity to provide a gentle introduction to mobile app development. Together we will build a fun working android app in about an hour.

What you will learn: 

+ Using the [MIT App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/) to build android apps in a visual way utilizing drag-and-drop building blocks. 
+ Using the [MIT AI2 Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3&hl=en) Android App for easy app deployment and testing. 
+ Where to find more project ideas. 
+ Advanced applications  

What to bring: laptop, android phone or tablet.
