title: "Meaningless Words"
---
So many words I encounter are meaningless fluff (which can probably be said for most of the stuff I write). Here's a list I've started keeping. Feel free to contribute.

  - **Premium Ice Cream** - Stores only sell premium ice cream from what I've found. It appears to be a voluntary label, which means it's pure marketing fluff.

  - **Full Featured** - When does something go from partially featured to full featured?
